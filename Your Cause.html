         <h3>Wildfire Damage</h3>

        <h3>Prevention and raising awareness</h3>
        <img id="charity" src="charity.jpg" alt=charity title=charity/>
        <p>The massive amount of damage and loss caused tons of orginizations to begin raising money for the victims and their families. One of these orgininizations is Pray for California. They are a non-profit ministry who raise awareness by accepting donations and praying for the families as a sign of respect and to make their community feel stronger. The DNR works to prevent wildfires by educating people about the dangers and burn restrictions.  </p>
        
        <p>Even though California and other states are prone to fires, there are ways of preventing them that we should talk about. Some prevention tactics are, making sure vehicles have operating spark arrestors, knowing the current wildfire risk of your area, keep flammable objects such as, lawnmowers, oil or gas cans and propane tanks at least 30 feet away from your house.These orginizations may not erase history but they do help to repair damage that has been done by the fires.
